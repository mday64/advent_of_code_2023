Line 4 of my real input:

??.???#???? 1,4,1

becomes

??.???#???????.???#???????.???#???????.???#???????.???#???? 1,4,1,1,4,1,1,4,1,1,4,1,1,4,1

Converting the groups to a pattern with the minimum number of dots:

#.####.#.#.####.#.#.####.#.#.####.#.#.####.#

To expand it to fit the pattern, we need to insert more dots, either between groups, or
before the first group, or after the last group.  For N groups, there are N+1 places
to put the dots.  If we have D dots left to place, then the number of possibilities
to check is (N+1)^D.

If the pattern is all question marks, then we can just do the exponentiation, and not
generate and test every possibility.

We can ignore any leading or trailing dots in the pattern.

If the pattern starts or ends with a group of hashes, we can simplify (is it really
better?) by removing that group of hashes, and the corresponding group length.

If the pattern starts or ends with hashes and question marks, we know that the
hash and enough question marks corresponds to the first/last group length, and
that there's only one choice, so we can remove them.

If the pattern starts/ends with a question mark and other question marks or hashes,
can we figure out where the hashes align within the group length?  That is, can we
deduce how many of the question marks on either side must be hashes?  Can we at
least deduce a possible range?

What about hashes and dots in the middle of the pattern?  Can we figure out how
to try aligning them with the group lengths?

Can we take advantage of knowing the part1 answer for a line to help calculate
the part2 answer for that same line?  In particular, can we know that the
separating question mark must be a dot, so we just raise part1's answer to
the fifth power for part2?  (Having 1's at the start or end of a group list,
or having question marks at the start and/or end of the pattern, tends to make
for very large numbers of arrangements.)
